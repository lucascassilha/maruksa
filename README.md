A pet management app :dog:
-----------------------------------
*Having a pet is a lot of responsibility! So let us help.*

Maruska registers your pet's information and reminds you of it when you NEED to be reminded.
Use it to better manage your pets. Get notifications about vaccines, medications, and appointments that you recorded!
Use our weight control feature to register your pet's weight every month and see the evolution!

Dogs, cats, birds, horses - we love them all! 


• No need for registration, just open the app and start using it!

• Works with no internet connection, so you can access it anywhere*

• NO ADS! Really - we are not kidding!

• Free, no need to purchase anything!

• Light - up to 13MB
